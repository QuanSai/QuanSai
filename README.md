## Hi, I'm Greg!
---

* **I am a person** before I am anything else.
* **I don't like following rules.**
* I like thinking, struggling with complicated questions.
* I like helping people realize they can learn anything.
* I started writing code in the mIRC client back in ~2002 (I was born in 1990 - forgive me).
  * I think software engineering is more an art than it is a craft.
  * I think programming languages are tools, a means to an end, hammers.
  * I like solving problems and seeing something that I built, the house.
  * I don't glorify the tools I use, the hammers.
  * I started programming so I could build scripts that run inside of mIRC.
    * I wanted to write text-based games. I was a kid.
    * Industry work is not fun/interesting.
* **I'm a generalist.**
  * I've worked at quite a few spots as a software engineer.
  * My default language choice is Python :snake:, but I'm not married to it.
  * I primarily work on developing back-ends for internet products.
    * I design and build web APIs.
    * I hate calling myself "fUlL-StACk" or "bACk-ENd", because that's stupid. I'm an engineer, a solver of problems, a builder. Those labels are new the result of exploitative industry folks who needed a way to sell software engineering to non-technical people.
* If you want to talk to me, I'm pretty open.
  * I like talking programming.
  * I like talking about new and old tech.
  * Just throw time on my calendar: https://iNeedToTalkToGreg.com/


I'll probably end up editing this so that it isn't as exhaustive a list.
